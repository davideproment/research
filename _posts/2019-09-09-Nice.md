I participated to the conference entitled [Universal features of hydrodynamical, optical and wave turbulence](https://turbnice19.sciencesconf.org) held at the Université Nice Sophia Antipolis, Nice, France. 
The event celebrated the retirement of [Marc E. Brachet]().
I gave a talk contribution on [Irreversible dynamics of superfluid vortex reconnections](./static/slides/190909_Nice.pdf).
