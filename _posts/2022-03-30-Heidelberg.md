I gave a research colloquium at the Heidelberg Center for Quantum Dynamics at the University of Heidelberg, Germany. The talk was on [Equilibrium and non-equilibrium description of negative temperature states in a one-dimensional lattice using a wave kinetic approach](/research/assets/slides/220330_Heidelberg.pdf).
