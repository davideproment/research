I attended the conference [European Turbulence conference (ETC17)](http://www.etc17.it) held in Turin, Italy. 

I gave a talk on [Flying in a syperfluid](../../../../../static/slides/190905_Torino.pdf).

I was awarded one of the two [Young Scientist Awards](https://euromech.org/prizes/young) for the best presentations at ETC17 by researchers under 35 (at the date of the conference).
