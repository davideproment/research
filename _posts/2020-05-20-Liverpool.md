I gave a research webinar at the [Aerospace Engineering Research Programme](http://pcwww.liv.ac.uk/~cadot/Aerospace_engineering_research_programme.pdf) hosted by the University of Liverpool. The talk was on [Flying in a superfluid: starting flow past an airfoil](/research/assets/slides/200520_Liverpool.pdf).
