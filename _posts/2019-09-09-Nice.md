I attended the conference [Universal features of hydrodynamical, optical and wave turbulence](https://turbnice19.sciencesconf.org) held at the Universit√© Nice Sophia Antipolis, Nice, France.

The event celebrated the scientific career of [Marc E. Brachet](http://www.lps.ens.fr/~brachet/Home.html).

I gave a talk on [Irreversible dynamics of superfluid vortex reconnections](../../../../../static/slides/190908_Nice.pdf).
