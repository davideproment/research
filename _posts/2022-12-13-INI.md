I gave a research seminar as part of the [Dispersive hydrodynamics: mathematics, simulation and experiments, with applications in nonlinear waves](https://www.newton.ac.uk/event/hyd2/) programme at the Isaac Newton Institute, Cambridge, UK. The talk was on [Stokes drift and impurity transport in a quantum fluid](/research/assets/slides/221213_INI.pdf).
