I gave a research talk at the Statistical mechanics, integrability and dispersive hydrodynamic workshop of the Dispersive hydrodynamics: mathematics, simulation and experiments, with applications in nonlinear waves programme at the Isaac Newton Institute, Cambridge, UK. The talk was on [Equilibrium and non-equilibrium description of negative temperature states in a one-dimensional lattice using a wave kinetic approach](/research/assets/slides/221017_INI.pdf).
