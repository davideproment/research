**Application deadline**:
27th November 2023

**Project description**

Come and join the research group of Dr Davide Proment to explore the intriguing application of holographic duality in modelling strongly interactive quantum fluids such as superfluid liquid helium and quantum Fermi fluids. 
This PhD opportunity is a key part of the exciting and innovative "Holographic Quantum Fluids" research project, funded by the EPSRC in collaboration with the University of Heidelberg (Heidelberg, Germany) and the European Laboratory for Non-Linear Spectroscopy (Florence, Italy).

This project seeks to bridge two distinct realms of physics: the AdS/CFT holographic duality, initially conceived within the framework of string theory, quantum field theory, and general relativity, with the fascinating world of quantum fluids and condensed matter. 
The ultimate goal is to model various facets of strongly interacting quantum fluids at finite temperatures for which comprehensive first-principle theoretical models are currently lacking.

By joining Dr Proment's research group at the University of East Anglia (UK), you will become part of a team with expertise in theoretical and numerical modelling of out-of-equilibrium quantum fluids. 
Throughout your PhD journey, you will have the opportunity to undertake visits to our project partners in Heidelberg (Prof. Carlo Ewerz and Prof. Thomas Gasenzer) and Florence (Dr Giacomo Roati) - a unique chance to collaborate with leading experts in the field.

We are actively seeking an exceptionally talented and motivated candidate with a first-class master's degree in physics or an equivalent qualification, who aspires to become a part of our dynamic and diverse research group. 
Essential prerequisites include a strong foundation in PDEs, numerical methods and quantum mechanics. While not mandatory, a background in general relativity, fluid mechanics, quantum field theory, and/or quantum fluids would be highly advantageous.

For further information, including references to relevant literature, please do not hesitate to get in touch with Dr Davide Proment via email at [d.proment@uea.ac.uk](mailto:d.proment@uea.ac.uk). 

**Funding Notes**

This PhD project is in a competition for a Faculty of Science funded studentship. Funding is available to UK applicants only and comprises ‘home’ tuition fees and an annual stipend of £18,622 (for a maximum of 3 years).
