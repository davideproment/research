I participated to the conference [European Turbulence conference (ETC17)](http://www.etc17.it) held in Turin, Italy. 
I gave a talk contribution on [Flying in a syperfluid](./static/slides/190905_Torino.pdf).

I was awarded one of the two Young Scientist Awards for the best presentations at ETC17 by researchers under 35 (at the date of the conference).
